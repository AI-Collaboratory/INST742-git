INST377 Dynamic Web Applications (Fall 2017)
==============
Myeong Lee, iSchool, University of Maryland
--------------

This repo provides course materials about Git for the INST 377 class.
Each folder has brief explanations about the topic and source code, if any. 

For the topics in the class, you need to get familiar with command line tools (e.g., Git Shell, Bash, Terminal). Of course, using a command line tool instead of GUIs is not intuitive, but many operations require only basic commands. Don't worry.

Most of the course slides are available on ELMS.
